####Bugs, Features, Enhancements etc.
- The adapter is still in its development stage, and as a result the functionality is still lacking in some areas & few bugs are expected. Please create issues in the github repository to address these. Also please try to include a test case or error log if you are reporting a bug. Good luck!
